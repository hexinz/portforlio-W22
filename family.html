		During the winter in 2021, when the COVID-19 is very severe at that time, my family 
		cook and have meals together everyday for as long as two months. Every one of us think it is a precious 
		reunion and a great opportunity for communication between family members. What's more, my mum's 
		sister can cook so delicious food that I couldn't wait to see what food we have for tomorrow!

		Sometimes, we also have <strong>barbeques</strong> in our garden. It is enjoyable to have meals with green plants around.
		But keep in mind that always be careful with the fire! Besides, having barbeques in Summer is also not a 
		good idea due to the annoying mosquitos.

		During Chinese New Year, Chinese National Holiday, or birthday and other memorial ceremony for passed family members,
		Shanghainese usually gather together. Different festivals have different traditions: having moon cakes in Chinese Dragon Boat 
		Festival and dumplings in Chinese New Year. For the memorial ceremony, traditions vary quite differently 
		in different locations in China. We usually have the so-called Ninbo Food for memorial ceremonies.
